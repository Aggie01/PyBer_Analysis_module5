# PyBer_Analysis

# Overview:
### PyBer, a ride-sharing app company, is seeking a detailed summary of all the rideshare data for "urban," "rural" and "suburban" type of city from January to early May of 2019.

# Purpose:
### Show the relationship between the type of city (urban, rural, suburban) and the number of drivers and riders.

# Methodology:
### Exploratory analysis of the PyBer's ride-sharing data will be perfomed using python, jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy and matplotlib.  

# Results:

  **Urban** outperformed on some key findings: **"Total Riders**," "**Total Driver**" and "**Total Fares**." 
  - The analysis clearly demonstrates that the urban type has over 30 times more drivers than the rural type.
  - Total Fares in urban area came close to $40,000 as opposed to only $4,327.93 for rural.
    
  **Rural** area scored the highest on **"Average Fare per Driver**" and "**Average Fare by Ride**" as compared to other two city types.
  - The Fare per Driver is at $55.49, whereas in urban type it is only $16.57.
